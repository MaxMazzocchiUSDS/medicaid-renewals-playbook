# Common Manual Renewal Issues

While there is a large focus at the moment on ex parte renewals and the (undisputed) benefit that they can bring to states, a majority of the Medicaid population will still have to complete a manual renewal. This population almost always includes the most vulnerable groups: people with income that cannot be verified electronically, non-citizens, newborns, etc. A manual renewal is often a complex and multi-step process, and one that is very rarely measured adequately. Implemented inefficiently or in a burdensome way, the manual renewal process can result in vast losses of coverage as clients fail to navigate through the myriad of steps towards renewing their coverage. 

Human-centered design principles can bring large improvements to this process, and result in coverage retention for the most vulnerable populations. Measurement is an important part of this, but not one that is mandated at the current moment. Improving the manual renewal process can mean helping a state understand where the roadblocks are and helping them overcome them with best practices or innovative pilots.
