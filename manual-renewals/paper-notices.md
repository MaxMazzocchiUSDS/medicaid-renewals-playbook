# Paper Notices

## Description

The first challenge with notices is getting them into the hands of people who need them. Many people have moved in the last 3 years and have not kept their address on file with the state up-to-date. See [Outreach & Messaging](./outreach-and-messaging.md) to learn more about that challenge.

Once people receive their notices, they may struggle to understand them. Notices sent by the state to recipients are subject to a large number of requirements in terms of content that must be included and formats it must be presented in. As a result, notices are often include confusing legaleze that is not relevant to the average medicaid participant. These notices can do more harm than good, as confused recipients may not take the necessary action, or may take the wrong action based on them.

The state eligibility/case workers may have the ability to add their own notes to notices, and many use this feature to add their own plain language descriptions to notices they are sending to their cases. However, this is variable and generally at the discretion of the individual worker.

Many states support multiple languages, and translations of notices can also be a common issue. Notices may be translated word-by-word rather than interpreting the entire sentence to make the most sense in that language, leading to nonsensical instructions. In other cases, they may use antiquated or uncommon dialects, which do not reflect the language being commonly spoken. In these instances members may seek help from friends, family, or a navigator. However, if an English copy is not also provided then the original intent of the notice may be impossible to trace back.

The timing of notices is also very important. Given mail delivery timelines can be inconsistent, multiple notices may come out-of-order.


## What this looks like

Navigators will often be the best source of data on confusing notices. If enrollees are coming to navigators with any of the following situations, there may be a notice issue:
  - Does not know when their renewal date is
  - Did not open or read their notice
  - Cannot read their notice due to a language issue
  - Cannot understand their notice because it is too complex
  - Doesn't understand what the notice is saying or what action is needed
  - Received conflicting notices

## Potential solutions

Plain text language updates can make a large difference in helping people understand their renewal notice. Relevant information should be at the beginning of the notice, and any actions required should be clearly stated with good visual hierarchy. Legal or irrelevant information should be move to the following pages. Changes to notices are often a lengthy process which require legal review, public comment periods, and other forms of red tape. A stop-gap solution may be to provide templatized language to case workers that can be copy/pasted into notices if their system allows them to add their own comments.

Translated notices should be vetted and tested to ensure they make sense. Navigator organizations specializing in particular languages can be leveraged in proofreading and giving feedback on translations. If possible, including English copies with translated notices also ensures that the original meaning can be traced back by another translater if the member struggles to understand the dialect used.

Notices should ideally be consolidated into one single notice that can be sent out at one time. This prevents conflicting notices from arriving out of order.
